that a decorator extension must extend consists of a draw() method and
a setToolkit() method. The toolkit passed in provides context for the
decorator. For example, a scalebar requires a viewport model and the
ability to calculate the extent of a map; the toolkit provides access
to that data. The toolkit the decorator receives is a read only toolkit.
A decorator is not permitted to change UDIG model information. It can
only display information.</td>

are listed under the layer menu and in context menus in the layer view
when a layer is right clicked. In order provide a scalable solution the
layer operation extension point requires a extension to declare a filter
that will allow the menu managers to determine whether the layer
operation is interested in the layer. If it is then the operation will
be added to the menu. Otherwise the operation will be left out of the
menu.</td>

</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>renderer</td>
<td>A Renderer interprets spatial data and represents the data in a visual
manner. In UDIG there are different types of renderers that can render
different types of data. For example, a feature renderer can render
features data. A WMS renderer can communicate with and render images
from a web map server. The API requires that a Renderer extension must
create a RenderMetrics class, which can provide metrics about how fast
a renderer can provide its service, a RenderMetricsFactory class, which
can determine if a data source can be rendered by the renderer and can
create RenderMetrics that provide metrics with regard to a particular
data source and, last, a renderer extension must provide an implementation
of the Renderer Interface. Normally by extending the abstract superclass
which handles threading and event notification for the renderer. For the
sake of simplicity and security a toolkit object is provided that the
renderer can use. This provides the user with a buffered image that the
renderer can write on and provide a single interface for obtaining all
information that the renderer may need.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>renderExecutor</td>
<td>Declares render executors to use for rendering particular types of
renderers. Renderers are not required to implement a executor. The default
ones will work in most cases.</td>

<tr class="row-even"><td>selectionOp</td>
<td>An definition for an operation on a map&#8217;s or layer&#8217;s current selection. A
layer&#8217;s selection is represented by the filter returned by getFilter. The
selection is the features selected by the filter. A map&#8217;s selection is the
join of all the layer&#8217;s selections.</td>

<td>Style Layer Desriptor (SLD) style content.</td>

<tr class="row-even"><td>style</td>
<td><p class="first">Configures a style object. Responsibilties include:</p>
<ul class="last simple">
<li>Creating a ui to allow user configuration of a style object.</li>
<li>Placing style object information onto the style blackboard of a layer.</li>
<li>Determining if a style configurator can be used to configure the style
of a particular layer.</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>styleDefinition</td>
<td>Styles are represented as a Memento object which contains style information
as a tree of mementos each of which contains strings. Only the renderers
that render a layer know the concrete style class. This means that only
certain renderers are capable of rendering certain styles. However as far
as UDig is concerned a style is a memento. This causes problems with the
user interface because udig does not know anything about the style. To
overcome this limitation a style must be associated with an editor dialog.
The editor must extend the StyleEditor class. A style is used for rendering
purposes. Renderers use style objects when rendering Layer data. A style can
be any object. Extenders are expected to create the style object itself, as
well as an implementation of StyleContent which is uses a factory for the
style. Style objects are placed onto a Layer blackboard so they can be
accessed by other entities such as Renderers and StyleConfigurators.</td>

<tr class="row-even"><td>styleConfigurator</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>templates</td>
<td>A Template is used to layout elements on a Page that will be use for
printing.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>tool</td>
<td><p class="first">Allows third-party developers to develop new tools for UDIG and is one of
the most used points of extension. There are three different type of tools
and two ways of grouping tools. The three type of tools are as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Action Tool</strong> - A single fire tool that performs a single action and is
not modal, a buttons that sets the viewport so it frames the current
selection is an example of an action tool. Action tools must implement the
ActionTool interface.</p>
<p><strong>Modal Tool</strong> - A tool that has on and off modes. When a modal tool is &#8220;on&#8221;
it waits for user input and reacts on it. An example of a modal tool is the
zoom tool. Modal tools must implement the ModalTool interface and are
recommended to implement the AbstractModalTool class.</p>
<p class="last"><strong>Background Tool</strong> - A tool that is always active in the background. A
typical background tool would be limited to providing user feedback. An
example is the cursor position tool that displays the current mouse location
in world coordinates. Background tools must implement the Tool interface
and are recommended to implement the AbstractTool class.
To address the need to provide locations for large numbers of tools
developers can add tools to views. In addition, a standard tool views is
defined and new tools are added to the tool viewer by default. It is
recommended that if a large number of tools are being added then a new view
should be created to hold the tool set. The setToolkit method is called by
UDIG in order to provide a tools with a toolkit object that it can use as
a facade for access UDIG, UDIG command factories and send command object
to UDIG.</p>
